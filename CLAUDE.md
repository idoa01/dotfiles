## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in Beads; use the `bd` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

**Mandatory rules — apply in every session, regardless of which skill is running:**

1. **Session start**: Run `bd prime` before doing any issue tracker work. Do not skip this even if the session feels like a continuation.
2. **Before working on an issue**: Claim it in the tracker before writing any code or making any changes.
3. **After completing an issue**: Close it in the tracker immediately. Do not batch closures to the end of a session.
4. **PRD-level issues are epics**: Every PRD-level issue must be created as an epic. Sub-issues must reference their parent epic.
5. **Closing an epic**: Close the parent epic only after every issue under it is closed. Before closing, verify that no child issue is in any non-closed state (ready, in-progress, blocked, or otherwise open). If the state of any child is unclear, display the current child issue states and ask the user for directions before proceeding.
6. **One issue per session**: Pick up exactly one issue per session. Once closed, stop — report what was done and any non-obvious decisions or complications, then go silent. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` for the full stop-and-report format.

### Triage labels

Default label vocabulary (needs-triage, needs-info, ready-for-agent, ready-for-human, wontfix). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
